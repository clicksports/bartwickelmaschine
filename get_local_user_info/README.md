Get User Info
=============

This Script is to check all non System (and root) User. It assumes that a uid over 500 is the switch to user generated accounts.

It will test if a user has set a password, sudo ability (not how deep) and list ssh-keys for the user (if present)

This was build after i got a bunch of Servers and try to get a overview who is able todo what.

nasty but working (on SLES, Centos, Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL)
