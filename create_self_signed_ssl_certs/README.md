# Create self-signed SSL certificates

This little script is a helper to generate fast without knowing the openssl syntax self-signed certificates.

> You should really not use this script, it was created because I needed this in some test/lab environments. If you want to setup something with a real value and real security you should use something like [shadowCA](https://github.com/graylog-labs/shadowCA) or [SimpleAuthority](http://simpleauthority.com/).
